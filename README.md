# Olympic Data Vizualization Project

### It shows a number of interactive visualizations built around the Olympic medals data set

The ultimate goal of this project is to make data-driven articles such as the ones presented on this page fully open and reproducible. This means that they should contain all the code needed to obtain the data from the original source. The current version is not quite there yet - it focuses on letting readers reproduce all the computations that were done when building visualizations and also to create and share custom perspectives on the data.
